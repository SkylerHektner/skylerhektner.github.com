			<li> <strong>C++ Gameplay Programmer </strong>
				<div>Grinding Gear Games <em>September 2019-Present</em> | <em></em>NA</em></div>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Path of Exile is a massively complex loot driven multiplayer Action RPG produced by Grinding Gear Games in New Zealand. I began working here as a C++ gameplay programmer and have since helped shipped 3 major expansions: <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/exilecon/three" target="_blank">Metamorph</a>, <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/delirium" target="_blank">Delirium</a>, and <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/harvest" target="_blank">Harvest</a>. I've worked on a lot of things so far (far too many to list here), but recently I'm quite proud of completely reworking our <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2870970" target="_blank">warcries</a> and implementing all the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2874544" target="_blank">crafting</a> options for our recent expansion Harvest.

					I interned at Dolby Laboratories in San Francisco during the summer of 2019. I was brought on to help prototype a VR demo which tested the viability of experimental immersive audio playback technologies. During my time I designed and engineered interactive demos in Unity and implemented signal processing algorithms in C++ to enable a custom in engine audio codec for the project.
