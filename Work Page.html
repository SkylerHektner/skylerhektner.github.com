				<hr>
				<p>
					I am currently very happy to be working at Bungie on the definitive Action MMO Destiny 2 as a part of the Investment Systems and Workflows team. In this role I use C++ and C#, working across build pipelines, tools, client, and server code to create and mantain player reward and progression systems. I have helped shipped 4 annual expansion: <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny/beyondlight" target="_blank">Beyond Light</a>, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/WitchQueen" target="_blank">Witch Queen</a>, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/destiny/lightfall" target="_blank">Lightfall</a>, and, soon, the <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/TheFinalShape" target="_blank">Final Shape</a>. During this time I have owned or otherwise contributed to major shipping features such as weapon crafting, loadouts, and the upcoming Pathfinder objective system. I have also taken on roles as the primary shephered for a number of technical and content systems as well as triaged a number of high priority live bugs.

I worked on a lot of things (too many to list here), but notably I'm quite proud of reworking <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2870970" target="_blank">warcries</a>, implementing all the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2874544" target="_blank">crafting</a> options for the Harvest, as well implementing every new and reworked <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2934377" target="_blank">skill</a> in the Heist challenge league.
