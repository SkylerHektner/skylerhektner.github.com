I worked on a lot of things (too many to list here), but notably I'm quite proud of reworking <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2870970" target="_blank">warcries</a>, implementing all the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2874544" target="_blank">crafting</a> options for the Harvest, as well implementing every new and reworked <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2934377" target="_blank">skill</a> in the Heist challenge league.
